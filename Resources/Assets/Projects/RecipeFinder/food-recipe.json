It is renowned for its nutty flavor and is often used in dishes such as tempeh stir-fries, sandwiches, and salads. Both tofu and tempeh are celebrated for their nutritional profile. They are rich in protein, low in saturated fats, and provide essential nutrients such as iron, calcium, and B vitamins.
