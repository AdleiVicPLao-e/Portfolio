      <p><em>Project Lead</em></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Technologies:</strong> CORBA IDL, Java (Server & Java GUI
        Client), Python (Non-Java Client), MySQL, Swing (Java GUI), Tkinter

        <li>
          <strong>CORBA-based Architecture:</strong> Defined CORBA IDL for all
          remote interfaces (authentication, matchmaking, game control,
          score/leaderboard queries) and used a CORBA ORB for inter-language
          connectivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Server (Java):</strong> Implemented the server-side component
          in Java — headless with log output — responsible for authentication
          (single-session enforcement), matchmaking, game orchestration, word
          validation (using <code>words.txt</code>), round timing, and
          persistence to MySQL (player wins, top words).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Java Client (GUI):</strong> Built a graphical Java client
          (Swing) that authenticates via CORBA, requests/join games, submits
          candidate words during 10-second rounds, and displays round results,
          longest-words list, and top-5 players.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-Java Client (Python):</strong> Implemented a Python client
          using a CORBA binding to demonstrate multi-language interoperability;
          GUI optional (Tkinter recommended for bonus). Supports the same login,
          game, and query features as the Java client.
