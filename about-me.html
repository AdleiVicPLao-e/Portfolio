    <p class="lead">
      Hi! I’m <strong>Adlei Vic P. Lao-e</strong>, a passionate and driven 
      <strong>Information Technology graduate from Saint Louis University</strong> 
      with a strong foundation in software development, data analysis, and web technologies. 
      As a <strong>DOST JLSS Merit Scholar</strong> and <strong>Cum Laude</strong>, I take pride in 
      my dedication to learning and excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expertise spans <strong>Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, MySQL, and R</strong>, with hands-on 
      experience in <strong>frontend and backend development</strong>, 
      <strong>API integration</strong>, and <strong>data visualization</strong>. 
      I’ve contributed to real-world projects such as developing digital solutions at <strong>Kaisipan, Inc.</strong>, 
      creating an <strong>AR-driven PWA for the SLU Museum of Igorot Culture</strong>, 
      and leading various <strong>academic and technical projects</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond coding, I value <strong>leadership, communication, and creativity</strong>. 
      I’ve honed these skills through <strong>student leadership roles, public speaking, 
      and artistic pursuits like poetry</strong>. I’m also deeply interested in how 
      technology and innovation can solve problems and make a meaningful impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to grow as a <strong>developer and problem solver</strong> while contributing 
      to projects that combine technical excellence with purpose. 
      I’m excited to connect, collaborate, and continue learning in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
